        <p>I've been working on it for a while now, but often find myself getting lost, or wanting to try and implement too many things, and forgetting about finishing something I've already started. I'm hoping the knowledge I gain from this course will help me focus on creating a strong MVP, enabling me to feel proud to showcase my website to the world, and find employment in a great company.</p>
